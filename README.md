A small 16ch 100MHz logic analyzer with 2-5V protected inputs that is 
compliant with SUMP/OLS and is usable in sigrok. It is based on 
the rp2040 rust logic analyzer firmware 
[`ula`](https://github.com/dotcypress/ula.git) written by 
[@dotcypress](https://github.com/dotcypress). The 
small form factor is designed for a socket to be designed into a circuit board 
using cheap and widely available m.2 sockets, or by using some custom 
carriers which allow you to use popular flying probes, like the ones 
provided with bitmagic or the classic HP 01652-61608.
